# Phishing Detector

## Introduction
Phishing Detector is a web application built in PHP using Laravel (a web application framework) with expressive and elegant syntax. We developed this web app to provide the users and customers from fake websites whose intent is to garble userâ€™s privacy and information. Phishing can be done in many way for instance: Fraudsters send fake emails or set up fake websites that mimic browsing to trick the user into disclosing his protected information like username, password, account details, OTP, etc. This practice is know as â€˜Phishingâ€™.

### Sign of Phishing Site:
* Suspicious URL (in correct company name, http:// (unsecured)).
* Unusual Pop-ups and Alert message.
* Unintentional redirect of URL, etc.
